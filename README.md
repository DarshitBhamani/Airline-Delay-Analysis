# ‚úàÔ∏è Airline Delay Analysis Project

This project analyzes the factors contributing to flight delays in the United States, using real-world data and predictive analytics techniques. It was completed as the final project for the **Business Analytics** course at **Conestoga College** during Winter 2024.

## üîç Key Findings

- **Delays by Year**:
  - 2019: 20.29% of flights were delayed (Every 5th flight)
  - 2020: 11.72% of flights were delayed (Every 10th flight)
- **Top Delay Reasons**:
  - Late Aircraft (57.4%)
  - National Aviation System (34.2%)
  - Weather (8.1%)
  - Security (<1%)
- **Best Performing Carriers**: Hawaiian Airlines, Delta, Alaska Airlines
- **Worst Performing Carriers**: JetBlue, ExpressJet, Mesa Airlines
- **Insights from Modeling**:
  - Linear Regression showed a perfect R¬≤, indicating direct calculation from delay components.
  - Need to explore more nuanced features to avoid data leakage and overfitting.

## üìà Scenario Analysis

- **Weather Forecasting Improvements**: Up to 1.5% delay time reduction with better forecasts.
- **Late Aircraft Recovery Plan**: Up to 11.3% delay reduction with operational improvements.
- **NAS Optimization**: Up to 6.7% delay reduction through better airspace management.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- Improve real-time weather prediction and runway scheduling systems.
- Implement efficient crew and aircraft turnaround processes.
- Leverage predictive dashboards for delay alerts.
- Invest in airport infrastructure to reduce NAS-induced delays.
